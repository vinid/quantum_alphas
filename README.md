## Input File Structure

the models expect a pickled file that has the following structure:

```python

{"s1" : array([[0.2, 0.3, 0.1, 0.4], [0.1, 0.3, 0.1, 0.9] ...]]),
 "s2" : array([[0.6, 0.3, 0.8, 0.4], [0.6, 0.3, 0.4, 0.9] ...]]),
 "l1" : array([0.2, 0.3, 0.1 ....]),
 "l2" : array([0.9, 0.5, 0.2 ....]),  
 "labels" : array([0.5, 0.6 .....]) }

```
